STARTED: 2026-01-17T06:35:00Z
COMPLETED: 2026-01-17T06:45:00Z
DURATION: 10 minutes

OBJECTIVES:
- Define YBSError enum with all error types
- Implement Logger class with multiple levels
- Add colored output support (optional, based on config)
- Add convenience methods for common logging patterns
- Create tests for error creation and logging
- Integrate with existing config system

ACTIONS TAKEN:
- Created Sources/YBS/Core/YBSError.swift with comprehensive error enum
- Implemented error categories: config (1000), file (1100), tool (2000), LLM (3000), safety (4000), general (9000)
- Created Sources/YBS/Core/Logger.swift with debug/info/warn/error levels
- Added ANSI color support for terminal output
- Implemented both instance and static logger methods
- Created verify-errors.swift for comprehensive testing
- All errors include clear, actionable messages with context

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
