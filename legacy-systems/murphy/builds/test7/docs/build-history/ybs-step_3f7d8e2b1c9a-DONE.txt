STEP 3f7d8e2b1c9a: run_shell Tool (Unsandboxed)
STARTED: 2026-01-18T03:07:00Z
COMPLETED: 2026-01-18T03:09:00Z
DURATION: 2 minutes

OBJECTIVES:
- Implement RunShellTool conforming to ToolProtocol
- Use Process API to execute commands
- Capture stdout and stderr separately
- Add timeout support
- Handle exit codes

ACTIONS TAKEN:
- RunShellTool already existed at Sources/YBS/Tools/RunShellTool.swift
- Tool already registered in ToolExecutor
- Verified implementation matches spec (Process execution, I/O capture, timeouts)
- Created verify-shell.swift for manual verification testing
- All verification checks pass

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
✓ Build succeeds with no errors
✓ RunShellTool registered in ToolExecutor
✓ Basic command execution works
✓ Command exit codes work
✓ Stdout capture works
✓ Stderr capture works
✓ Working directory works
✓ Timeout support implemented

VERIFICATION ATTEMPTS: 1

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
- None (tool already implemented)

FILES CREATED/MODIFIED:
- verify-shell.swift (created for verification)
- Sources/YBS/Tools/RunShellTool.swift (already existed)

NEXT STEP: ybs-step_a1b2c3d4e5f6 (Step 20: Provider Configuration)
