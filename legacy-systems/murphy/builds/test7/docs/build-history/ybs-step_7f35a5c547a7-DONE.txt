STEP 7f35a5c547a7: Core Data Models
STARTED: 2026-01-17T06:25:00Z
COMPLETED: 2026-01-17T06:35:00Z
DURATION: 10 minutes

OBJECTIVES:
- Define Message struct for chat messages
- Define Tool struct for tool definitions
- Define ToolCall struct for tool invocations
- Define ToolParameter struct for tool schemas
- Add Codable conformance for JSON serialization
- Create comprehensive tests for encoding/decoding
- Verify models match OpenAI API format

ACTIONS TAKEN:
- Created Sources/YBS/Models/Message.swift with all message roles
- Created Sources/YBS/Models/Tool.swift with tool definitions and parameters
- Created Sources/YBS/Models/ToolCall.swift with tool invocation and result models
- Added convenience initializers for common message types
- Implemented ToolCall.parseArguments() for type-safe argument parsing
- Created verify-models.swift for comprehensive manual testing
- All models are Codable and Equatable as required

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
✓ Build succeeds with no errors
✓ Message creation works for all roles (system, user, assistant, tool)
✓ Message JSON encoding/decoding works correctly
✓ Tool creation with parameters works
✓ Tool JSON encoding works
✓ ToolCall creation and argument parsing works
✓ ToolResult success/failure cases work
✓ All 26 verification tests pass

VERIFICATION ATTEMPTS: 1

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
- Testing framework not available (same as Step 4)
- Resolution: Created manual verification script
