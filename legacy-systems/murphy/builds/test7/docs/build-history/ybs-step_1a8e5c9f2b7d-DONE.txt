STEP 1a8e5c9f2b7d: search_files Tool (Grep-like)
STARTED: 2026-01-18T03:05:00Z
COMPLETED: 2026-01-18T03:07:00Z
DURATION: 2 minutes

OBJECTIVES:
- Implement SearchFilesTool conforming to ToolProtocol
- Add recursive directory traversal
- Add regex pattern matching
- Return matches with context (line numbers + content)
- Limit results (max matches per file, max total matches)

ACTIONS TAKEN:
- SearchFilesTool already existed at Sources/YBS/Tools/SearchFilesTool.swift
- Tool already registered in ToolExecutor
- Verified implementation matches spec (regex search, recursive, filtering)
- Created verify-search.swift for manual verification testing
- All verification checks pass

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
✓ Build succeeds with no errors
✓ SearchFilesTool registered in ToolExecutor
✓ Basic search works (text matching)
✓ File pattern filter works (*.swift, etc.)
✓ Case-insensitive search works
✓ Regex pattern matching works
✓ Recursive directory search works
✓ Result limiting implemented

VERIFICATION ATTEMPTS: 1

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
- None (tool already implemented)

FILES CREATED/MODIFIED:
- verify-search.swift (created for verification)
- Sources/YBS/Tools/SearchFilesTool.swift (already existed)
