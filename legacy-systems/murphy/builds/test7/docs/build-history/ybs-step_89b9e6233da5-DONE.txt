DURATION: 4.6 minutes

OBJECTIVES:
- Read architecture decisions from ARCHITECTURE.md
- Create Swift-specific project structure
- Initialize Swift Package Manager with dependencies
- Create initial project files (Package.swift, main.swift)
- Create project documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md, docs/)
- Verify build environment works

ACTIONS TAKEN:
- Read architecture: Swift + macOS only
- Created Swift package structure (Sources/test7, Tests/test7Tests)
- Created Package.swift with dependencies:
  - swift-argument-parser (1.3.0+)
  - async-http-client (1.20.0+)
- Created main.swift with initial welcome message
- Built project successfully (swift build)
- Ran executable and verified output
- Updated README.md with project details
- Updated CLAUDE.md with build commands and structure
- Created docs/ directory with:
  - BUILD.md (build instructions)
  - TESTING.md (testing guidelines)
  - USAGE.md (usage documentation)
- Updated BUILD_STATUS.md with build environment info
