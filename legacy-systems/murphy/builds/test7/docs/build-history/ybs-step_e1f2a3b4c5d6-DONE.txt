STEP e1f2a3b4c5d6: Apple Foundation Model Integration
STARTED: 2026-01-18T06:30:00Z
COMPLETED: 2026-01-18T07:00:00Z
DURATION: 30 minutes

OBJECTIVES:
- Add detection for Apple Foundation Model availability (macOS 15+)
- Create AppleLLMClient as placeholder for future implementation
- Update provider system to recognize "apple" provider

ACTIONS TAKEN:
- Created AppleMLDetection.swift with system version checking
  - isAvailable() method checks for macOS 15.0+
  - systemInfo() provides detailed version information
- Created AppleLLMClient.swift as protocol-conforming placeholder
  - Implements LLMClientProtocol interface
  - Returns clear error messages explaining not yet implemented
  - Includes note about using Apple Intelligence framework when available
- Integrated with existing provider system via LLMClientFactory

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
✓ swift build completed successfully
✓ AppleMLDetection properly detects macOS version
✓ AppleLLMClient conforms to LLMClientProtocol
✓ Factory pattern correctly routes to Apple client when provider="apple"
✓ Clear error messages guide users on current limitations

VERIFICATION ATTEMPTS: 1

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
None. Implementation straightforward as placeholder structure.

FILES CREATED/MODIFIED:
- Sources/YBS/LLM/AppleMLDetection.swift (created)
- Sources/YBS/LLM/AppleLLMClient.swift (created)
- Sources/YBS/LLM/LLMClientFactory.swift (modified to include Apple case)
