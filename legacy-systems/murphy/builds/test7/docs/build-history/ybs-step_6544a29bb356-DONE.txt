STEP 6544a29bb356: Tool Executor Framework
STARTED: 2026-01-17T19:14:54Z
COMPLETED: 2026-01-17T19:15:36Z
DURATION: 0.7 minutes

OBJECTIVES:
- Create ToolExecutor class
- Implement tool registry (name → ToolProtocol)
- Implement execute method (takes name + args, returns result)
- Add tool discovery (list all available tools)
- Add schema generation (for LLM tool definitions)
- Integrate logging
- Create tests

ACTIONS TAKEN:
- Created ToolExecutor.swift with complete tool registry
- Implemented tool registration with automatic builtin registration
- Implemented execute method with logging and error handling
- Added availableTools() method for discovery
- Added toolSchemas() method for LLM tool definitions
- Added executeMultiple() for batch execution
- Added helper methods (hasTool, tool)
- Created comprehensive tests (ToolExecutorTests.swift)
- Built project successfully
- Verified executable works

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
✓ ToolExecutor class created in Sources/YBS/Core/ToolExecutor.swift
✓ Tool registry works (stores tools by name)
✓ Tool execution works (execute method with async support)
✓ Schema generation works (toolSchemas returns Tool array)
✓ Logging integrated (debug, info, warn, error levels)
✓ Tests created in Tests/YBSTests/ToolExecutorTests.swift
✓ Build succeeds (swift build)
✓ Executable runs (swift run test7 --version)
