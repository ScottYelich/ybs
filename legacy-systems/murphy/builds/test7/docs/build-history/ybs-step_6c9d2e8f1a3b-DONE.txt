STARTED: 2026-01-18T03:03:00Z
COMPLETED: 2026-01-18T03:05:00Z
DURATION: 2 minutes

OBJECTIVES:
- Implement EditFileTool conforming to ToolProtocol
- Add exact text search and replace
- Validate search text is unique in file
- Add fuzzy matching (optional whitespace tolerance)
- Generate diff output showing changes

ACTIONS TAKEN:
- EditFileTool already existed at Sources/YBS/Tools/EditFileTool.swift
- Tool already registered in ToolExecutor
- Verified implementation matches spec (search/replace, uniqueness check, diff)
- Created verify-edit.swift for manual verification testing
- All verification checks pass

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
✓ Build succeeds with no errors
✓ EditFileTool registered in ToolExecutor
✓ Basic edit works (search and replace)
✓ Search not found handling works
✓ Non-unique search detection works (prevents ambiguous edits)
✓ Multiline edit works
✓ Diff generation implemented

VERIFICATION ATTEMPTS: 1

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
- None (tool already implemented)

FILES CREATED/MODIFIED:
- verify-edit.swift (created for verification)
- Sources/YBS/Tools/EditFileTool.swift (already existed)
