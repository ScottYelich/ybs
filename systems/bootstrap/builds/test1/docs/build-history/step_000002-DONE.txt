STEP 000002: Set Up Project Environment
COMPLETED: 2026-01-16 19:25:00

OBJECTIVES:
- Read architecture decisions from ARCHITECTURE.md
- Create language-specific project structure
- Initialize build tools and package manager
- Create initial project files
- Create project README.md (for humans)
- Create project CLAUDE.md (for AI agents)
- Create docs/ directory with standard documentation
- Verify build environment works
- Document completion

ACTIONS TAKEN:
- Read ARCHITECTURE.md to confirm Swift + macOS choice
- Created Swift package structure (Sources/test1, Tests/test1Tests)
- Created Package.swift with dependencies:
  - swift-argument-parser (1.7.0)
  - async-http-client (1.30.3)
- Created Sources/test1/main.swift entry point
- Ran swift build - completed successfully (158.28s first build)
- Ran swift run test1 - verified output matches expectation
- Created comprehensive project README.md with build/test/usage info
- Updated project CLAUDE.md to v0.2.0 with Swift-specific commands
- Created docs/BUILD.md with Swift build instructions
- Created docs/TESTING.md with XCTest guidelines
- Created docs/USAGE.md with usage placeholder
- Updated BUILD_STATUS.md with build environment section

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
✓ ARCHITECTURE.md read successfully
✓ Swift package structure created
✓ Package.swift configured with correct dependencies
✓ main.swift created and compiles
✓ swift build completes without errors
✓ swift run test1 produces expected output:
  - "test1 - LLM Coding Assistant"
  - "Version: 0.1.0"
  - "Build environment initialized successfully!"
✓ Project README.md created with comprehensive information
✓ Project CLAUDE.md updated to v0.2.0
✓ docs/BUILD.md created with Swift-specific build instructions
✓ docs/TESTING.md created with XCTest guidelines
✓ docs/USAGE.md created with usage placeholders
✓ BUILD_STATUS.md updated with build environment info

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
None

FILES CREATED:
- builds/test1/Package.swift
- builds/test1/Sources/test1/main.swift
- builds/test1/docs/BUILD.md
- builds/test1/docs/TESTING.md
- builds/test1/docs/USAGE.md

FILES MODIFIED:
- builds/test1/README.md (replaced placeholder with comprehensive version)
- builds/test1/CLAUDE.md (updated to v0.2.0)
- builds/test1/BUILD_STATUS.md (added build environment section, updated status)

DEPENDENCIES RESOLVED:
- swift-argument-parser: 1.7.0
- async-http-client: 1.30.3
- Plus 20+ transitive dependencies (NIO, SSL, etc.)
