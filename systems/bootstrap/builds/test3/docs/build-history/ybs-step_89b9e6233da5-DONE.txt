STEP 89b9e6233da5: Set Up Project Environment
STARTED: 2026-01-17 06:31 UTC
COMPLETED: 2026-01-17 06:32 UTC
DURATION: 1 minute

OBJECTIVES:
- Read architecture decisions from ARCHITECTURE.md
- Create Swift-specific project structure
- Initialize Swift Package Manager with dependencies
- Create initial project files (Package.swift, main.swift)
- Create comprehensive documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md, BUILD.md, TESTING.md, USAGE.md)
- Verify build environment works

ACTIONS TAKEN:
- Read ARCHITECTURE.md and confirmed language choice: Swift
- Created Swift package directory structure: Sources/test3/, Tests/test3Tests/
- Created Package.swift with dependencies (swift-argument-parser, async-http-client)
- Created main.swift with initial welcome message
- Verified Swift build completes successfully
- Verified program runs and produces expected output
- Updated README.md with complete project documentation
- Updated CLAUDE.md with Swift-specific development guidance
- Created docs/BUILD.md with build instructions and troubleshooting
- Created docs/TESTING.md with testing guidelines and examples
- Created docs/USAGE.md with usage documentation (to be filled as features are added)
- Updated BUILD_STATUS.md with build environment info

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
✓ ARCHITECTURE.md confirmed language: Swift
✓ Project structure created correctly (Sources/test3/, Tests/test3Tests/)
✓ Swift Package Manager initialized
✓ Dependencies configured (ArgumentParser, AsyncHTTPClient)
✓ Initial build succeeds (swift build)
✓ Program runs and prints welcome message (swift run test3)
✓ README.md updated with complete project info
✓ CLAUDE.md updated with development guidance
✓ docs/BUILD.md created with build instructions
✓ docs/TESTING.md created with testing guidelines
✓ docs/USAGE.md created with usage documentation
✓ BUILD_STATUS.md updated with build environment section

VERIFICATION ATTEMPTS: 1

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
None. Swift package structure created successfully and build verified working on first attempt.

FILES CREATED:
- builds/test3/Package.swift
- builds/test3/Sources/test3/main.swift
- builds/test3/docs/BUILD.md
- builds/test3/docs/TESTING.md
- builds/test3/docs/USAGE.md

FILES MODIFIED:
- builds/test3/README.md (updated with full project details)
- builds/test3/CLAUDE.md (updated to v0.2.0 with Swift-specific guidance)
- builds/test3/BUILD_STATUS.md (added build environment section)

NEXT STEP: None - all 4 steps completed (100%)

BUILD ENVIRONMENT READY: Yes

TIMING SUMMARY:
- Start: 2026-01-17 06:31 UTC
