STARTED: 2026-01-16 23:03 UTC
COMPLETED: 2026-01-16 23:04 UTC
DURATION: 1 minute

OBJECTIVES:
- Read language and platform choices from BUILD_CONFIG.json
- Document all choices in BUILD_STATUS.md
- Create ARCHITECTURE.md with decisions and rationale
- Verify documentation

ACTIONS TAKEN:
- Read language choice from BUILD_CONFIG.json: Swift
- Read platform choice from BUILD_CONFIG.json: macOS only
- Documented that LLM providers will be configurable via config system
