STEP 89b9e6233da5: Set Up Project Environment
STARTED: 2026-01-16 23:04 UTC
COMPLETED: 2026-01-16 23:06 UTC
DURATION: 2 minutes

OBJECTIVES:
- Read architecture decisions from ARCHITECTURE.md
- Create Swift-specific project structure
- Initialize Swift Package Manager with dependencies
- Create initial project files
- Verify build environment works
- Create comprehensive documentation

ACTIONS TAKEN:
- Read language choice from ARCHITECTURE.md: Swift
- Created Swift Package directory structure:
  - Sources/test4/ (source code directory)
  - Tests/test4Tests/ (unit tests directory)
- Created Package.swift with dependencies:
  - swift-argument-parser (~1.3.0) for CLI parsing
  - async-http-client (~1.20.0) for HTTP requests
  - Configured for macOS 14+ platform
- Created Sources/test4/main.swift with welcome message
- Verified build completes successfully (swift build)
- Verified program runs and produces expected output (swift run test4)
- Updated README.md with language/platform info and build commands
- Updated CLAUDE.md to v0.2.0 with Quick Start section and Swift build commands
- Created comprehensive documentation:
  - docs/BUILD.md (build instructions for Swift)
  - docs/TESTING.md (testing guidelines with XCTest)
  - docs/USAGE.md (usage documentation template)
- Updated BUILD_STATUS.md with build environment section

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
✓ ARCHITECTURE.md read to determine language (Swift)
✓ Swift Package directory structure created correctly
✓ Package.swift initialized with correct dependencies
✓ main.swift created with welcome message
✓ Build completes without errors (455 files compiled)
✓ Program runs and prints welcome message successfully
✓ README.md updated with Swift-specific information
✓ CLAUDE.md updated to v0.2.0 with build commands
✓ docs/BUILD.md created with comprehensive Swift build instructions
✓ docs/TESTING.md created with XCTest guidelines
✓ docs/USAGE.md created with usage template
✓ BUILD_STATUS.md updated with build environment info
✓ All documentation contains actual values (no placeholders)

VERIFICATION ATTEMPTS: 1

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
Minor warning about test directory location during build, but executable works correctly. This is expected at this stage with no test files yet.

FILES CREATED:
- builds/test4/Package.swift
- builds/test4/Sources/test4/main.swift
- builds/test4/docs/BUILD.md
- builds/test4/docs/TESTING.md
- builds/test4/docs/USAGE.md

FILES MODIFIED:
- builds/test4/README.md (updated with Swift-specific details)
- builds/test4/CLAUDE.md (updated to v0.2.0 with build commands)
- builds/test4/BUILD_STATUS.md (added build environment section, marked complete)

DIRECTORIES CREATED:
- builds/test4/Sources/test4/
- builds/test4/Tests/test4Tests/
- builds/test4/docs/

NEXT STEP: All 4 steps completed! Build framework validated successfully.

BUILD ENVIRONMENT READY: Yes ✓

TIMING SUMMARY:
- Start: 2026-01-16 23:04 UTC
- End: 2026-01-16 23:06 UTC
- Duration: 2 minutes
