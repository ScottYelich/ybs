STEP c5404152680d: Define Architecture & Choose Technology Stack
STARTED: 2026-01-17 07:39 UTC
COMPLETED: 2026-01-17 07:40 UTC
DURATION: 1 minute

OBJECTIVES:
- Read language and platform choices from BUILD_CONFIG.json
- Document all choices in BUILD_STATUS.md
- Create ARCHITECTURE.md with decisions and rationale
- Verify documentation

ACTIONS TAKEN:
- Read language choice from BUILD_CONFIG.json: Swift
- Read platform choice from BUILD_CONFIG.json: macOS only
- Documented that LLM providers will be configurable
- Created ARCHITECTURE.md documenting:
  - Technology stack (Swift, macOS only)
  - Implementation notes (SPM, XCTest, AsyncHTTPClient)
  - Platform-specific details (sandbox-exec, Foundation APIs)
  - LLM integration strategy (configurable via JSON)
  - Core architecture principles (local-first, minimal deps, extensible, secure)
  - Tool architecture (hybrid: built-in + external)
  - Security model (sandboxing, confirmations, blocked commands)
- Updated BUILD_STATUS.md with architecture section
- Verified all documentation created

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
✓ Language read from config: Swift
✓ Platform read from config: macOS only
✓ LLM provider strategy documented (configurable)
✓ ARCHITECTURE.md created with complete documentation
✓ BUILD_STATUS.md updated with architecture decisions
✓ All choices documented and verified
