STEP 89b9e6233da5: Set Up Project Environment
STARTED: 2026-01-17 07:40 UTC
COMPLETED: 2026-01-17 07:45 UTC
DURATION: 5 minutes

OBJECTIVES:
- Read architecture decisions from ARCHITECTURE.md
- Create Swift-specific project structure
- Initialize Swift Package Manager with dependencies
- Create initial project files (Package.swift, main.swift)
- Create project documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md, docs/)
- Verify build environment works

ACTIONS TAKEN:
- Verified language choice: Swift
- Created Swift Package structure:
  - Sources/test5/ directory
  - Tests/test5Tests/ directory
- Created Package.swift with dependencies:
  - swift-argument-parser ~1.3.0
  - async-http-client ~1.20.0
  - Platform target: macOS 14+
- Created Sources/test5/main.swift with welcome message
- Updated README.md with Swift-specific details:
  - Build commands (swift build, swift run, swift test)
  - Project structure diagram
  - Prerequisites (Swift 5.9+, macOS 14+)
- Updated CLAUDE.md (version 0.2.0) with:
  - Swift build commands
  - Updated project structure
  - Development workflow
  - Testing requirements
- Created docs/ directory with documentation:
  - docs/BUILD.md - Build instructions, troubleshooting
  - docs/TESTING.md - Testing guidelines, XCTest examples
  - docs/USAGE.md - Usage documentation (to be filled)
- Verified build works:
  - swift build completed successfully
  - swift run test5 executed and displayed welcome message
  - All dependencies resolved from GitHub

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
✓ Swift Package structure created correctly
✓ Package.swift configured with correct dependencies
✓ main.swift created with entry point
✓ README.md updated with language-specific details
✓ CLAUDE.md updated with Swift commands (version 0.2.0)
✓ docs/BUILD.md created
✓ docs/TESTING.md created
✓ docs/USAGE.md created
✓ Build completes without errors
✓ Program runs and prints welcome message
  Output: "test5 - LLM Coding Assistant / Version: 0.1.0 / Build environment initialized successfully!"
