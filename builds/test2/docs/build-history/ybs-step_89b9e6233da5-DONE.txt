STEP ybs-step_89b9e6233da5: Set Up Project Environment
COMPLETED: 2026-01-17 05:40 UTC

OBJECTIVES:
- Read architecture decisions from ARCHITECTURE.md
- Create language-specific project structure (Swift)
- Initialize build tools and package manager
- Create initial project files
- Create project documentation (README, CLAUDE.md, BUILD.md, TESTING.md, USAGE.md)
- Verify build environment works

ACTIONS TAKEN:
- Read ARCHITECTURE.md to confirm Swift + macOS choices
- Created Swift Package Manager structure (Sources/test2, Tests/test2Tests)
- Created Package.swift with dependencies:
  - swift-argument-parser (1.3.0+)
  - async-http-client (1.20.0+)
- Created Sources/test2/main.swift with initial welcome message
- Verified build completes successfully (swift build)
- Verified program runs and produces expected output (swift run test2)
- Updated README.md with comprehensive project documentation
- Updated CLAUDE.md to version 0.2.0 with build commands and workflow
- Created docs/BUILD.md with build instructions and troubleshooting
- Created docs/TESTING.md with testing guidelines and conventions
- Created docs/USAGE.md with usage documentation (placeholder for future)
- Updated BUILD_STATUS.md with build environment info

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
✓ ARCHITECTURE.md read to determine language (Swift)
✓ Swift Package structure created correctly
✓ Package.swift created with correct dependencies
✓ Initial source file (main.swift) created
✓ Build completes without errors
✓ Program runs and prints welcome message:
  - "test2 - LLM Coding Assistant"
  - "Version: 0.1.0"
  - "Build environment initialized successfully!"
✓ README.md updated with full project documentation
✓ CLAUDE.md updated with Swift-specific commands
✓ docs/BUILD.md created
✓ docs/TESTING.md created
✓ docs/USAGE.md created
✓ BUILD_STATUS.md updated

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
None. Warning about test files location is expected since no test files exist yet.

FILES CREATED:
- Sources/test2/main.swift
- Package.swift
- docs/BUILD.md
- docs/TESTING.md
- docs/USAGE.md

FILES MODIFIED:
- README.md (updated to version with full documentation)
- CLAUDE.md (updated to version 0.2.0)
- BUILD_STATUS.md (added build environment section, marked step complete)

NEXT STEP: To be determined (only 3 steps exist currently)

BUILD ENVIRONMENT READY: Yes
