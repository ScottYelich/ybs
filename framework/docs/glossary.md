## Core Framework Terms

### YBS (Yelich Build System)
The methodology and framework that enables AI agents to build complete software systems autonomously through structured files (specs, steps, decisions, checklists).

**Not**: A tool, an application, or the Swift chat tool
**Is**: A meta-framework for autonomous system development

**Example usage**: "YBS can guide building any system - calculators, web apps, databases, AI agents, anything."

---

### Meta-Framework
A system for building systems that build systems. YBS provides the structure (methodology) for having AI agents build complete systems.

**Synonym**: Methodology (preferred for clarity)
**Related**: Framework

**Example usage**: "YBS is a meta-framework - it guides AI agents through building systems, but isn't the system itself."

---

### Framework
The YBS methodology, specifications, and build step system. Prefer "methodology" to avoid confusion with software frameworks.

**Synonym**: Methodology (preferred)
**Not to be confused with**: Software frameworks like React, Rails

**Example usage**: "The YBS framework includes specs/, build-from-scratch/, and helper scripts."

---

### Methodology
**Preferred term** for YBS itself. The systematic approach to providing sufficient details for autonomous system building.

**Why preferred**: Less ambiguous than "framework" or "meta-framework"

**Example usage**: "YBS is a methodology that provides sufficient specifications and details for AI agents to build ANY system autonomously."

---

## Build Process Terms

### Build
1. **Noun**: An instance of a system being constructed in `builds/SYSTEMNAME/`
2. **Verb**: The process of constructing a system

**Context required**: Make clear from context whether referring to the noun or verb

**Example usage**:
- "The test5 build is complete" (noun)
- "Let's build a calculator using YBS" (verb)
- "builds/test5/ contains the build output" (noun)

---

### Step
A single unit of work in the build-from-scratch framework. Each step has objectives, instructions, verification criteria, and traceability to specs.

**File format**: `ybs-step_<12-hex-guid>.md`
**Location**: `docs/build-from-scratch/steps/`

**Example usage**: "Step 0 collects all configuration values upfront."

---

### Step 0
The mandatory first step that collects all configuration values upfront to enable autonomous execution of subsequent steps.

**Special status**: Must be executed before any other step
**Output**: BUILD_CONFIG.json

**Example usage**: "Always execute Step 0 first to generate BUILD_CONFIG.json."

---

### BUILD_CONFIG.json
Configuration file generated by Step 0 containing all user choices for a build.

**Location**: `builds/SYSTEMNAME/BUILD_CONFIG.json`
**Purpose**: Enable autonomous execution without user prompts

**Example usage**: "Steps 1-N read from BUILD_CONFIG.json instead of asking the user."

---

### BUILD_STATUS.md
Status tracking file for a build showing current step, progress metrics, and completion status.

**Location**: `builds/SYSTEMNAME/BUILD_STATUS.md`
**Updated**: After each step completes

**Example usage**: "Check BUILD_STATUS.md to see which step is currently in progress."

---

## Specification Terms

### Spec
A specification document defining WHAT to build. Can be system-wide, business, functional, technical, or testing specs.

**Location**: `docs/specs/`
**Purpose**: Requirements, architecture, decisions

**Example usage**: "The technical spec defines the API surface."

---

### System Spec
System-wide specification documents in `docs/specs/system/` that define the overall architecture and design.

**Files**: ybs-spec.md, ybs-decisions.md, ybs-lessons-learned.md

**Example usage**: "System specs apply to the entire project, not individual features."

---

### ADR (Architectural Decision Record)
A document explaining WHY an architectural choice was made, what alternatives were considered, and the trade-offs.

**Location**: `docs/specs/system/ybs-decisions.md`
**Format**: D01, D02, D03, etc.

**Example usage**: "See ADR D09 for why we chose sandbox-exec on macOS."

---

### Decision
**See**: ADR (Architectural Decision Record)

**Example usage**: "The decision to use Swift is documented in D01."

---

## Bootstrap Terms

### Bootstrap
The first system being built WITH YBS to validate and refine the framework. Currently a Swift-based AI chat tool for macOS.

**Important**: The bootstrap is ONE example, not THE only thing YBS can build

**Example usage**: "The bootstrap happens to be an AI agent, but YBS could just as easily build a calculator."

---

### Bootstrap Implementation
The Swift/macOS AI chat tool that serves as the first test case for the YBS framework.

**Location**:
- Specs: `docs/specs/system/`
- Build: `builds/test5/` (or current build)

**Example usage**: "The bootstrap implementation demonstrates that YBS provides sufficient detail for autonomous development."

---

### Reference Implementation
**Synonym**: Bootstrap implementation

**Clarification**: The bootstrap is the FIRST reference implementation, not the ONLY one

**Example usage**: "The Swift bootstrap is a reference implementation showing how YBS works."

---

## Component Terms

### Tool
An operation the AI agent can perform (file I/O, shell execution, etc.).

**Types**: Built-in tools (compiled) vs External tools (runtime-loaded)

**Example usage**: "The agent has 6 built-in tools and can load unlimited external tools."

---

### Built-in Tool
A tool compiled directly into the agent binary for security, performance, and tight integration.

**Examples**: read_file, write_file, edit_file, list_files, search_files, run_shell

**Example usage**: "Built-in tools run in the agent's sandbox."

---

### External Tool
A runtime-loaded executable that follows the JSON protocol (input via argv, output via stdout).

**Language-agnostic**: Can be written in any language
**Purpose**: Extensibility without recompiling

**Example usage**: "Users can add external tools without modifying the agent."

---

### Agent
1. **General**: An AI system that can use tools and take actions
2. **Specific**: The YBS bootstrap implementation (Swift AI chat tool)

**Context required**: Make clear which meaning applies

**Example usage**:
- "AI agents like Claude can execute YBS build steps" (general)
- "The agent loop should be < 100 lines" (bootstrap specific)

---

### Agent Loop
The core execution cycle: read input → call LLM → execute tools → repeat

**Purpose**: Main control flow of an AI agent
**Target**: < 100 lines for the bootstrap

**Example usage**: "The agent loop is deliberately simple for maintainability."

---

### LLM (Large Language Model)
The reasoning engine that determines what tools to call and how to respond.

**Examples**: Claude, GPT-4, Ollama models
**Role**: Provides intelligence, not tool execution

**Example usage**: "The LLM can be local (Ollama) or remote (OpenAI, Anthropic)."

---

### Provider
An LLM service provider (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).

**Configuration**: Selected via config file
**Abstraction**: Agent uses provider abstraction for flexibility

**Example usage**: "The bootstrap supports multiple providers through a common interface."

---

## Process Terms

### Session
1. **Build session**: The period during which a build is actively being worked on
2. **Agent session**: A single run of the agent from start to exit

**Context required**: Make clear which type

**Example usage**:
- "The build session lasted 15 minutes" (build)
- "The agent session ended when the user typed exit" (agent)

---

### SESSION.md
Transient crash-recovery scratchpad file that captures session state for recovery.

**Location**: Repository root (deleted after successful completion)
**Purpose**: Enable instant resume after crashes

**Example usage**: "If SESSION.md exists, a previous session crashed - read it and resume."

---

### scratch/
Directory for temporary working files during a session.

**Location**: Repository root
**In .gitignore**: Yes (never committed)
**Cleanup**: After successful session completion

**Example usage**: "Put analysis documents in scratch/ while working."

---

### Autonomous Execution
The ability of an AI agent to complete multiple build steps without user intervention.

**Enabled by**: Step 0 (BUILD_CONFIG.json)
**Goal**: Primary design objective of YBS

**Example usage**: "After Step 0, Claude can execute 10+ steps autonomously."

---

## Architecture Terms

### Hybrid Tool Architecture
Tool design combining built-in tools (compiled) with external tools (runtime-loaded).

**Purpose**: Balance security, performance, and extensibility

**Example usage**: "The hybrid tool architecture allows 6 core built-in tools plus unlimited external tools."

---

### Sandbox
Security mechanism that restricts tool execution to allowed operations.

**Types**: Path sandbox (file access) and shell sandbox (command execution)

**Example usage**: "The sandbox blocks access to ~/.ssh and ~/.aws directories."

---

### Path Sandboxing
Restricting file operations to explicitly allowed directories.

**Mechanism**: Deny-by-default with allow-list

**Example usage**: "Path sandboxing prevents reading SSH keys."

---

### Shell Sandboxing
Restricting shell command execution through OS-level mechanisms.

**macOS**: sandbox-exec
**Linux**: bubblewrap, firejail, seccomp
**Windows**: Job objects, AppContainer

**Example usage**: "Shell sandboxing uses sandbox-exec on macOS."

---

### Configuration Layer
One level in the hierarchical configuration system.

**Layers** (low to high priority): Defaults → System → User → Project → CLI

**Example usage**: "Project config in .ybs.json overrides user config in ~/.config/ybs/config.json."

---

### Traceability
The ability to trace every implementation decision back to its originating specification.

**Mechanism**: "Implements" and "References" sections in steps

**Example usage**: "Traceability ensures specs and implementation stay synchronized."

---

## Status Terms

### in_progress
A step or build is currently being worked on.

**Example usage**: "Mark the todo as in_progress when you begin work."

---

### completed
A step or build has been finished and verified successfully.

**Example usage**: "Step 3 is completed - all verification checks passed."

---

### blocked
A step failed verification 3 times and cannot proceed without user help.

**Example usage**: "The build is blocked - manual intervention required."
